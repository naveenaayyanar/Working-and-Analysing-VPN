VPN Role in Privacy & Secure Communication

 1. VPN Encryption and Tunneling

A VPN creates a secure tunnel using tunneling protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IPSec. This tunnel encrypts all data packets exchanged between your device and the VPN server.

* Encryption Algorithm: Usually AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys), which is considered highly secure.
* Tunneling Protocol: Encapsulates your original data packet inside another packet for secure transport.



 2. IP Address Masking

Your device’s real IP address is replaced with the VPN server’s IP address. This prevents websites or observers from identifying your real location and ISP.

 3. Privacy Protection

| Aspect                 | Without VPN                 | With VPN                              |
| - |  | - |
| IP Address             | Real IP visible             | VPN server IP shown                   |
| Data Encryption        | None or weak (HTTP traffic) | Strong AES-256 encryption             |
| ISP Tracking           | Possible                    | Prevented (traffic encrypted)         |
| Geo-Restriction Bypass | Not possible                | Possible (connect to other countries) |



 4. Benefits of VPN Security

| Benefit                  | Description                                               |
|  |  |
| Data Confidentiality | Encryption prevents data interception                     |
| Data Integrity       | Tunneling protocols ensure data is not altered            |
| Authentication       | VPN authenticates user and server to prevent MITM attacks |
| Access Control       | VPN restricts access only to authorized users             |
