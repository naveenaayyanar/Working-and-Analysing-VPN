🔐 How Encryption Works in a VPN

✅ What is Encryption in VPN?

**Encryption** is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext), so unauthorized users cannot access it. In a VPN, encryption ensures that even if someone intercepts your data, they **cannot read or modify it** without the correct decryption key.


📊 Process: How VPN Encryption Works

1. **User initiates connection** to VPN client (e.g., ProtonVPN).
2. **Authentication** happens using credentials or certificates.
3. A **secure tunnel** is established between your device and the VPN server using a tunneling protocol.
4. **Encryption algorithms** are applied to all data before it's sent through the tunnel.
5. The VPN server **decrypts the data**, then forwards it to the internet.
6. The same process happens in reverse for incoming data.

🧪 Example: AES-256 Encryption (Used in Many VPNs)

* **Algorithm:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
* **Key Size:** 256 bits = 2⁽²⁵⁶⁾ possible keys (brute-force attack is practically impossible)
* **Block Cipher:** Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (128-bit blocks)

🔐 **Example (simplified)**:

* Plaintext: `HelloWorld`
* Encrypted: `n38aY89sNf9H!al2...` (unreadable to third parties)
* Only devices with the **correct key** can decrypt and read it.


🔄 Tunneling Protocols + Encryption Used in VPNs

| Protocol        | Encryption Method          | Notes                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenVPN**     | AES-256-CBC or AES-256-GCM | Open-source, very secure                     |
| **WireGuard**   | ChaCha20                   | Lightweight, fast, modern                    |
| **IKEv2/IPSec** | AES-256                    | Great for mobile devices due to reconnection |


🛡️ Why VPN Encryption Matters

* **Privacy**: Hides online activity from ISPs, hackers, and trackers
* **Security**: Protects against data theft, especially on public Wi-Fi
* **Anonymity**: Masks IP and encrypts traffic to prevent profiling
