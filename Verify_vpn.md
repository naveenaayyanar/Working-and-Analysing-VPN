âœ… How to Verify VPN is Working

 ðŸ”¹ 1. Check IP Address Before VPN

* Disconnect the VPN (if already connected).
* Open browser â†’ go to: [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
* Note your original IP address and location.


 ðŸ”¹ 2. Connect to VPN

* Open your VPN client (e.g., ProtonVPN).
* Click on a free server and connect (e.g., Netherlands).
* Wait until the status says Connected.


 ðŸ”¹ 3. Check IP Address After VPN

* While connected to the VPN:

  * Open [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) again
  * It should now show a different IP and location (not your original one).

âœ… Result: If the IP and location have changed â€” your VPN is successfully hiding your real IP address.


 ðŸ”¹ 4. Confirm Encrypted Traffic (Optional but Good Practice)

* Visit a site like [https://ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net) or [https://dnsleaktest.com](https://dnsleaktest.com)
* These tools show:

  * Your VPN IP address
  * If your DNS requests are leaking (they shouldn't be!)
* ðŸ“¸ Screenshot any results if asked to include in your report


  ðŸ”¹  5. Disconnect & Recheck (For Comparison)

* Disconnect from VPN in your client
* Go back to [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
* Check if your original IP is restored
* This proves the VPN is toggling your IP correctly
